# TechScholar
This was a part of our scholarship program, to scan a file on your computer and extract the number of times each word was used.
This was a way to recreate a resume filter, which is usually used to scan a resume to find certain key words that a company is usually looking for.
It'll extract the file (Based off the enetered location) and make a csv file so that it'll count each and every word in the extracted file.
I'm sure there was a much easier way to do this, we coulkd have cleaned the hub a bit more to be user friendly as well.
Was our first big project as a group while also still doing classes, so I hope you find it useful.
